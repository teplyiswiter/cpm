Add basic meta tags and also Opengraph, Schema.org Microdata, Twitter Cards and Dublin Core metadata to optimize your web site for better SEO.

== Description ==

*Add-Meta-Tags* (<abbr title="Add-Meta-Tags Wordpress plugin">AMT</abbr>) adds metadata to your content and *WooCommerce* products, including the basic *description* and *keywords* meta tags, [Opengraph](http://ogp.me "Opengraph specification"), [Schema.org](http://schema.org/ "Schema.org Specification"), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards "Twitter Cards Specification") and [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org "Dublin Core Metadata Initiative") metadata.

It also supports advanced *SEO title* customization letting you take control of the title generation on every part of the web site. Moreover, a basic *breadcrumb trail* generator is provided for use with hierarchical post types. Last, but not least, it lets you customize the *locale* on a per post basis generating a proper `hreflang` for a signle language and, also, is out-of-the-box compatible with WPML and Polylang multilingual plugins (through the WPML language configuration file that ships with the plugin).

It is actively maintained since 2006 (historical [Add-Meta-Tags home](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/05/add-meta-tags-wordpress-plugin/ "Official historical Add-Meta-Tags Homepage")).

*Add-Meta-Tags* is one of the personal software projects of George Notaras. It is developed in his free time and released to the open source WordPress community as Free software.

= IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT POLICY CHANGE =

For some technical, but mostly for non-technical reasons, I no longer monitor, participate or provide support in the wordpress org forums. This decision is final. Please check the [description page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/add-meta-tags/) of the plugin for information about your free support options. Your detailed feedback is always welcome and much appreciated.

Keep in mind that stable releases of this plugin will continue to be pushed to the subversion repository at wordpress org as usual, so that your self hosted wordpress sites can automatically receive updates from the default plugin repository.

Rest assured that my plugins are actively and well maintained regardless of my involvement or non-involvement in the wordpress community. Development has always been taking place on an external facility anyway, so it is not affected in any way.

Your feedback is welcome.
 - Option to force the use of the content's custom title, if one has been set in the post editing screen, in the titles within the metadata. By default the custom title is used only for the 'title' HTML element. (Props to fatherb, bolt24, vtinath, Craig Damon and others)

 - Internal media limit (configurable via filter) increased from 10 to 16. (Props to Eduardo Molon for feedback.)

- [2.9.0](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/297)
 - **IMPORTANT NOTICE 1**: All help text messages and examples of the settings page have been moved to the integrated WordPress help system. This has been done in order to make the settings page easier to navigate. While at the settings page, press the `HELP` button on the top right corner and browse through the various sections in order to get detailed information about the available settings.
 - **IMPORTANT NOTICE 2**: It is no longer possible to enter the URLs of the Publisher's social media profiles in the WordPress user profile pages. Instead, publisher information should be entered in the relevant fields of the **Publisher Settings** section of the settings page.
 - The administration interface has been reworked.
 - Removed publisher related settings from user profile pages.
 - Improved the algorithm that collects the embedded media so that it excludes media which are just linked from the content and not embedded into the content.
 - Added option that limits the generated media metadata to one media file of each media type (image, video, audio). See `Media Limit` in the settings page. (thanks all for providing feedback about this feature - too many to list here)
 - Added support for pre-defined full meta tag sets, which can be used in the 'Full Meta Tags' box ([more info](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Plugin_Functionality_Customization#Create-Pre-Defined-Full-Meta-Tag-Sets)). (props to aferguson for ideas and feedback)
 - Re-invented the 'Express Review' feature. Admittedly, creating a review has become a little more complex, but the new way of creating reviews is as simple as it can possibly get without sacrificing flexibility. If you have an idea about how to make it even simpler, please let me know.
 - This release contains an alpha version of JSON-LD schema.org metadata generator. By enabling it in the settings, schema.org metadata is added in the head section of the web page as an `application/ld+json` script, instead of embedded microdata in the content. This feature currently exists only for testing. Your feedbackis welcome.

Changelog information for older releases can be found in the ChangeLog file or at the [roadmap](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/roadmap "Add-Meta-Tags Roadmap") on the [Add-Meta-Tags development web site](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags).
